# Parallel Cramer's Rule Solver Benchmark

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to write a program that computes the solution to a system of linear equations using **Cramer's Rule**. The focus is on high-performance computing techniques, specifically:

1.  **Algorithm**: Use Cramer's Rule, which requires computing determinants.
2.  **Scale**: Handle systems where the number of equations $n > 1000$ (approx. $1000 \times 1000$ matrix).
3.  **Parallelism**: Use `fork()` to create multiple child processes to speed up the determinant computations.
4.  **Memory Management**: Use dynamic memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`) for 2D and 1D arrays.
5.  **Benchmarking**: Compare the execution time between sequential execution (or fewer cores) and parallel execution (utilizing all available cores).

## Prerequisites
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Linux / WSL Required**: This project uses Unix-specific system calls such as `fork()`, `wait()`, and command-line tools like `lscpu` and `rm`. It **will not** run natively on Windows. Please use **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** or a Linux Virtual Machine.

-   **GCC Compiler**: For compiling C code (`sudo apt install gcc`).
-   **Python 3**: For running the AI-generated automation script.
-   **Make/Build Tools**: Standard Linux build essentials (`sudo apt install build-essential`).

## Project Structure
The codebase is divided into two distinct implementations:

1.  **[Our Solution](./Our%20solution/)**: A modular, manually optimized implementation split across multiple files for better maintainability and structure.
2.  **[AI Generated](./AI%20Genarated/)**: A single-file implementation generated by AI, accompanied by a Python automation script.

## Quick Start
To run the solutions, navigate to the respective directories and follow the instructions in their READMEs.

### Running "Our Solution"
```bash
cd "Our solution"
gcc interface.c cramer.c matrix.c det.c -o cramer_bench
./cramer_bench
```

### Running "AI Generated"
```bash
cd "AI Genarated"
python3 auto_runner.py
# OR manually:
gcc solution.c -o cramer_ai -lm
./cramer_ai 300
```
